# Instructions

First put file "id3_test_main.py" in root folder (next to DecisionTree.py, ID3.py,...)

Then run by doing

```
$ python3 id3_test_main.py > my_test_prints.txt
```

You'll get the output of the prints inside of "my_test_prints.txt"

## How to use id3_test_main.py

At the bottom of the file, where the `if __name__ == '__main__'` line is.
You'll see commented out tests. Gradually, uncomment each one as you code the ID3.py, and rerun the id3_test_main.py file.
See that the prints are as you expected.

### possible_solutions.txt

The file possible_solutions.txt has the prints of my solution. You can use this to compare.
